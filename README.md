# labelPrintingAutomation
Script for automate label printing process.

This project was made to automate the label printing activity in a company. The activity consisted in taking batches and quantitities and insert on a web platform to print labels. This process is done for around 30 batches per day and doesn't aggregate any value. So I used python, selenium and pyautogui to automate the browser commands and openpyxl to get the data from an excel sheet.
